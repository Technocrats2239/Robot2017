Where things are:
C:\Users\hopki\wpilib\tools\SmartDashboard.jar
C:\Users\hopki\wpilib\tools\OutlineViewer.jar
C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2016\project\roboRIO Tool\roboRIO_ImagingTool.exe
C:\Users\hopki\wpilib\tools\java-installer.jar
C:\Program Files (x86)\FRC Radio Configuration Utility\FRC Radio Configuration Utility.exe


RoboRIO imaging:
C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2016\project\roboRIO Tool and double click on roboRIO_ImagingTool.exe
This may fail on the first try.
Then, go to http://roborio-2239-frc.local/ in order to connect to the RoboRio (You must use Internet Explorer, not Microsoft Edge)
Check to make sure the PDP has the correct firmware version matching with the version on
http://www.ctr-electronics.com/pdp.html#product_tabs_technical_resources
Change the device ID on the PDP to 1. It needs a different device ID than the PCM in order to be able to communicate with the PCM.
Click "save". Make sure the device ID stays at 1.
Refresh the page and make sure the PCM shows up this time.
Now check the Firmware on the PCM (same website, just different component)
Now, install Java on the RoboRIO: C:\Users\hopki\wpilib\tools\java-installer.jar


Radio Configuration:
C:\Program Files (x86)\FRC Radio Configuration Utility\FRC Radio Configuration Utility.exe
If connected by Ethernet, choose "Ethernet"


Kangaroo:

Setup:
Download rufus (non-portable version) onto windows computer (technocrats computer).
Download Ubuntu Desktop (.iso)
Plug in wipeable flashdrive (takes up about 1.6 GB)
Run rufus with settings as shown on their website
Plug into Kangaroo and install. (There is some special setting you need to change before it installs. Hit F2 or something? Don't remember)
Setup done.

Needs to be plugged into the radio port farthest away from the power supply on the radio
To open GRIP with a project, run the following command:
/opt/GRIP/GRIP -f filename.grip
(So far, the above command has been failing. We have submitted a bug report)

Checking network table values from Kangaroo on RoboRIO:
Use C:\Users\hopki\wpilib\tools\OutlineViewer.jar
Then, enter 10.22.39.2 as the host
Then click "Start Client"
The values should pop up. If they don't, make sure you actually have a connection to the robot.
(For example, check http://roborio-2239-frc.local/#Home on Windows Explorer or check the Driver Station Connection)

Issue with connecting to the field even though offline connection works so far:
https://github.com/WPIRoboticsProjects/GRIP/issues/536

How to get the OutlineViewer to work:
Connect both computers to 2239 internet via wifi.
ifconfig on kangaroo. Look at inet address. Type that into outline viewer and use host. (it's usually 10.22.39.14)
ipconfig on windows computer. Look at IPv4 address. Type that into GRIP. (It's usually 10.22.39.82)
Done.

Camera:
Striped power cord = black = ground
Plug into the port closest to the kangaroo's power cable in order to get it as Webcam 0.
Camera lights are 12 volt 500 mA and plugged into the Voltage Regulator Module

Egit (git for Eclipse):
How to import new project from git:
File>>Import>>Git>>Projects from Git (with smart import)
You must use smart import. Don't know why the other one doesn't work but it just doesn't.

If weird errors occur:
Copy what files you need. Then try combinations of "pull...", "fetch from upstream", and hard resets.
Then paste your files back in and commit.

How to upload project:
Right click Robot2017>>Team>>Commit
Drag the files from unstaged changes to staged changes
Type a commit message.
Commit if you just want to store it on your computer. Commit and push if you want to do both.

How to revert back to old version:
Right click on project (Robot2017)
Team>>Show in History
Find the revision you want. Right-click it and rebase. You will need to redownload the current version.
There may be a way to look at the code without having to redownload everything.
You can look at just the revised pages if you open the history file in the commit page and then click on the file.
But that doesn't open anything that wasn't revised in that particular commit.

How to download the most current version:
Right click on project
Team>>Fetch from Upstream
Team>>Revert>>Hard


Other Errors:
If the driver station is saying there's no robot code, it could be an issue within the code.
Revert back to a version you know was working and see if that one still works.
If it does, it's a coding issue. Check for "while (true)" loops.
If it doesn't, it's not a coding issue.
